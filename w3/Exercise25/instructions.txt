The following implementation solves the puzzle:

    1. Define a queue of subjects as an array of nSubject elements. The
elements contain the eye color and optionally the order number of the
generated subject.

    2. When a new subject is added to the queue, visit all the queue's
elements from the first to the last.

    3. The first subject to insert into the queue is inserted at the queue's
front.

    4. If there are subjects in the queue, visit all subjects from the first
to the last, and insert the new subject at the position of the first subject
having blue eyes, moving all remaining existing subjects one position farther
in the queue.

    5. If the end of the (used) queue is reached insert the new subject at the
end, beyond the last subject in the queue.

    6. When inserting a subject, determine its eye color using a random number
generator (e.q., if an odd value is generator the eye color is blue, otherwise
brown), and optionally store its order number.

At the end, display the contents of the queue from front to back, showing eye
colors and optionally order numbers.
