Redirection:
When changing code in a program to write a file, one can use redirection in
order to append the code in the already existing file, rather than erasing and
rewriting the entire file. This saves time.

In the code " program <in> out " the executable "program" uses "in" as input file
and produces file "out" as output file.

Piping:
Piping passes information from one program to another. One program can passes
a parameter such as the output into the pipe, where it is stored. The other
program can then use the information in the pipe as, for example, input. Pipes
can be one way or two way.

In the code " code | less" the output of the program "code" is piped to the
program "less". less allows one to view the output of program "code" one
screen-full at a time.
