The difference between \texttt{std::copy} and \texttt{std::for\_each} is centered primarily around the fact that \texttt{std::copy} leaves the original intact (unless, of course, as in exercise 47 the destination range is the same as the origin). Furthermore, the \texttt{std::for\_each} algorithm applies a 'transformation' (i.e. function) to the range, while copy does not. Hence, the latter is applicable for applications where some kind of function must be applied to all elements of a container.
