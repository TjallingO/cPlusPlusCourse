Here, I used the following approach to shed the excess capacity of the \texttt{vector} in the class. Using the \texttt{swap} function, the data member \texttt{d\_vWords} is replaced with an anonymous new \texttt{vector} constructed directly using the iterators of the original \texttt{d\_vWords}. In this process, the size and capacity of the anonymous (and new \texttt{d\_vWords}) are immediately set appropriately.
\texttt{shrink\_to\_fit} should not be used because, as stated, it is merely a request to the compiler to shed capacity. It is therefore not always executed, even though it seems to constitute an explicit command. Furthermore, in a class environment, it makes more sense to construct similar functionality for all data members of said class to 'clean up' the data allocation, as it were, and to ensure that these instructions are actually executed.
