Users of a Derived object can use all public members of the Base Class.
Designers of Derived can use all public and protected members of the
 Base Class.

In the case of protected inheritance all public members from the Base Class
become protected instead.
Users are now denied access to all base class members.
When designing a class that is derived from Derived this new class access is
allowed to the base class's public and protected members.
Designers of Derived can still use all public and protected members of the Base
Class.
