What would be the problem when inheriting your class OpusMagnus from WIP
(so:class OpusMagnum: private WIP)?

This results in the strongest kind of coupling and should only be used when
OpusMagnus is implemented in terms of WIP. But since these terms are still
subject to change, performing operations on data_members that may not be
there after a new release would result in errors.

The same question, but now you're using

class OpusMagnus
{
  WIP d_wip;
  ...
};

Here composition is used and among other data members we define an object
from class WIP as a data member. Once again when performing operations on
data members that may not be there after a new release would results in errors.

Show how the problem can be avoided by using a slightly different kind of
composition.

We can solve this by ???
