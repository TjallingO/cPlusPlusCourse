Difference between a declaration and a definition
  A declaration is merely the announcement of the existence of a symbol, like a
  function, variable, etc, and the type thereof (e.g. int). A definition actually
  assigns meaning to those symbols, such as what the function does or which
  value the variable is assigned.

Header files
  Header files are used to import, as it were, often-used functions to be able
  to use them in one's own program(s). As such, it precludes having to write all
  this functionality ourselves, and standardizes the usage of some functionality.

Header files and libraries
  Header files are inserted as if they were copy pasted from their source into
  the source code at the place of the include statement. As such, it is used at
  the moment of compilation. Libraries, however, are included at the linking
  phase, i.e. when the executable is generated.

Libraries
  A library is not an object module since the object module is created by
  the compiler. The object module contains the code including calls to functions
  but it does not know what to do with the functions yet. This information
  is in the libraries. In the linking phase the compiler links the object
  module to the library such so that functions can be used.

Why is an object module obtained after compiling a source containing
int main() not an executable program?
  Before it is linked it is "relocatable object code": the object's place in the
  executable program is not yet known. It first needs to be linked to the
  objects and to the libraries.
