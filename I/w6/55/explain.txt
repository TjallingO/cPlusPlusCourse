As can be seen, the new addition consists of a destructor ~Strings(); defined in the header and implemented in dtor.cc. In turn, this destructor calls the previously-defined destroy(); (see destoy.cc, included for convenience). The destructor is automatically called when the object goes out of scope, so this ensures that the memory allocated by the objects is deleted in such a situation (as it would be before enlarging it).
