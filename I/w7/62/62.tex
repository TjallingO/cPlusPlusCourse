As before, istr has error state flags. After it has been assigned to something for the first time, istr is now fully read until its end, and its \texttt{eofbit} has been set / toggled accordingly. In order to utilise istr again, its error state flags must be cleared, using \texttt{std::ios::clear} (i.e. \texttt{istr.clear();}).

\begin{lstlisting}[style=inline]
...
cout << "extracted first number: " << no1 << '\n';

istr.clear();       // Clear error state flags
istr.str(argv[2]);  // Sets istr to a copy of argv[2]
size_t no2 = 0;
istr >> no2;        // Assign contents of istr to no2
...
\end{lstlisting}
