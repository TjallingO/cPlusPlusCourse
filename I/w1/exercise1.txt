Short descriptions of object file and executable
  Object file
    Compiled version of the source code (contained in hello.cc). In some sense
    it can be considered to be an intermediate file, as it cannot run yet but
    is machine code.
  Executable
    Compiled and linked version of the source code, and is executable.

The output of the program is as follows
  Hello World

File sizes
  hello.cc (source file)  153 bytes
  hello.o (object file)   2696 bytes
  hello (executable)      6208 bytes
  iostream (library)      2695 bytes
