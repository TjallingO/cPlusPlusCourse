Programming in C/C++
Week 1: Assignment 3

1. Empty program
  Yes, it is valid. It produces no visible result.

2. Nonstandard main function
  Yes, it is valid, however it is nonstandard and the third parameter should
  be avoided.

3. Empty return value
  No, it is not valid. The snippet says to return something, but not what. Hence,
  the program can be fixed by adding either a 0 or a 1. However, the line can also
  be removed entirely, as the program will already return a 0 by default.

4. Comparing
  Yes, when adding a semicolon to the end, the snippet is valid. However, it does
  'do' anything. Yes, the size of the character c is 1, but no function is dependent
  on this fact. It could, for example, be used in an if-statement.

5. Argument array
  No, however the program will run. The value of argc (i.e. 1), representing
  the number of arguments passed to the main function, is used as the array position
  in the array argv[]. Since there is only one argument, and the array starts
  at position zero, this should be invalid or undefined.

6. End program
  It will work, however using such a function is not recommended. Instead,
  reordering one's code to lead to a natural ending (i.e. the end of the main
  function) is preferred.

7. enum definition
  Yes, that is valid. It would work either way, but it is not required to preface
  an enum with typedef.

8. Index evaluation sequence
  Yes, this refers to the fourth position within the third position of the array
  argv. It is evaluated starting from the variable itself, moving outward.
