In line 98, the + operator is defined to return a BinExpr of which the third
template argument is ADD. In the struct which is then returned the operator[]
(line 45) is defined to return a function cp which is a member of a struct
with a template parameter operation, which in this case is ADD, as this was
the third template argument provided to the struct BinExpr in which the struct
Operation is nested.

Changing the ADD in line 77 to MUL generates errors since it will now attempt
to call a function from a struct Operation with a third template argument SUM
in a struct encompassing it with third template argument SUM. Which has not
been defined. Since the only options for the third template argument are now
MUL and SUB.

So the association is made in line 45.
